While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is {@condition incapacitated}. A {@spell wish} spell can't restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards. |\n| [object Object] | Flames | A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies. |\n| [object Object] | Skull | You summon an {@creature avatar of death|dmg}-a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the DM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own {@creature avatar of death|dmg}. A creature slain by an {@creature avatar of death|dmg} can't be restored to life. |\n| [object Object] | Idiot* | Permanently reduce your Intelligence by {@dice 1d4 + 1} (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws. |\n| [object Object] | Donjon* | You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can't be located by any divination magic, but a {@spell wish} spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards. |\n| [object Object] | Ruin | All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears. |\n| [object Object] | Euryale | The card's {@creature medusa}-like visage curses you. You take a -2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse. |\n| [object Object] | Rogue | A nonplayer character of the DM's choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a {@spell wish} spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you. |\n| [object Object] | Balance* | Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your alignment to change. Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on you. |\n| [object Object] | Fool* | You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level. |\n| [object Object] | Jester | You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws. |\n* Found only in a deck with twenty-two cards","weight":0,"value":0,"type":"G"},{"name":"Demon Armor","source":"DMG","srd":true,"type":"HA","tier":"major","rarity":"very rare","weight":65,"description":"While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you can understand and speak Abyssal.

When the world seemed doomed, the wizards of the Towers of High Sorcery came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five Orbs of Dragonkind (or Dragon Orbs) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.\nAs the Towers of High Sorcery fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.\nEach orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.\nAn orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.\nWhile attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb's depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become {@condition charmed} by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.\nWhile you are {@condition charmed} by the orb, you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts {@spell suggestion} on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Takhisis ({@creature Tiamat|RoT|Tiamat's} name on Krynn), or something else the DM decides.\n## Random Properties\nAn Orb of Dragon kind has the following random properties:\n[object Object]\n## Spells\nThe orb has 7 charges and regains {@dice 1d4 + 3} expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: {@spell cure wounds} (5th-level version, 3 charges), {@spell daylight} (1 charge), {@spell death ward} (2 charges), or {@spell scrying} (3 charges). You can also use an action to cast the {@spell detect magic} spell from the orb without using any charges.\n## Call Dragons\nWhile you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as {@creature Tiamat|RoT} are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can't be used again for 1 hour.\n## Destroying an Orb\nAn Orb of Dragonkind appears fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath weapons of dragons. A {@spell disintegrate} spell or one good hit from a +3 magic weapon is sufficient to destroy an orb, however.","value":0,"type":"G"},{"name":"Ox","source":"PHB","srd":true,"type":"TG","rarity":"none","value":1500,"description":"","weight":0},{"name":"Pack Saddle","source":"PHB","srd":true,"type":"TAH","rarity":"none","weight":15,"value":500,"description":""},{"name":"Painter's Supplies","source":"PHB","srd":true,"type":"AT","rarity":"none","weight":5,"value":1000,"description":""},{"name":"Pale Tincture","source":"DMG","srd":true,"type":"G","rarity":"none","value":25000,"description":"A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 3 ({@dice 1d6}) poison damage and become {@condition poisoned}.
