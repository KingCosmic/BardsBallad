/**
 * Handles the user logout process.
 *
 * This function clears authentication-related storage, updates the
 * authentication state to reflect that the user is logged out, and empties
 * all tables in the database. It uses asynchronous operations to clear
 * database tables efficiently.
 *
 * Updates:
 * - Clears data stored in `AuthStorage`.
 * - Clears data stored in `SyncStorage`.
 * - Resets the authentication state to indicate the user is logged out,
 *   removing any user-specific details and synced characters.
 * - Clears all database tables asynchronously.
 *
 * @async
 * @function
 * @returns {Promise<void>} Resolves when all tasks are completed, including
 * database table clearing.
